- TODO: fix init functions
- look up how to make python classes that have a ton of input variables

- each individual gets a certain about of steps that they can take.
- we can think of that number of steps as money/capital/influence anything that might someone explore more opportunities, ease one's way in the world.

# TODO
- add identifier to Person class so we can see how and where people move.
- check that the move_someone method actually works
- if we are slow, only loop over the board once per iteration.
    - probably don't need to recalculate empty spaces every iteration. They change by 2 every iteration in veryt predictable way since one person moves.

# paper
The argument could be made that schelling's model doesn't model the migrations patterns of white and blacks in neighborhood because it neglects important pressures such as Imminent Domain, White Flight, changes in housing prices, parent's desire for good schools, closeness to work, and the list goes on. 

I claim that these criteria increase in the complexity of the model. We start with this model that captures some aspect of these relations, and we see that this model robustly exhibits chaos and segregation. 

Now, we add more contstaints to the model, and we check if this increases the chaos and segregation, or decreases it. 

I hypothesize that it will either increase the chaos and cause it to stay the same. 

The contrains that will be added will be less mathemetical - in the sense that they are less predicact, dependent on randomness and differences between individuals, so they should if anything produce strangeer behavior on the macro scale. 

That being said, there is the argument that in mass, large amounts of various influences can create a more orderly world. 

For example, say we have a neighborhood that has schelling's traditional rules exhibiting chaotic behavior. 

Then we consider the fact that these persons also work various jobs in various parts of the country, so they may not know the race of their neighbors. 

In order to add this into the model, we have the vision of a person be a random variable set at the time we intialize the model. 

Then perhaps the model will exhibit less chaotic behavior because most people won't have a large enough vision to notice the races surroudning them, and a few persons will move around a ton because they're vision is large enough to never satisfy their preferences. 


In this case we see that increasing the complexity of the model leads to more order.

This leads to large philospophical point that CA prove the enlighten: 
is the w
orld chaotic because the rules are random and chaotic? 
or is the world chaotic because of the rules synergize? 
or is the world chaotic because the rules are simple, but lead to complex, chaotic behavior, like class 3/4 of wolfram
or ...

If the world is chaotic, why is it chaotic?
